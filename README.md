# asteroids
Part of the pygame course from boot.dev. This is to re-create asteroids using pygame.

# How to play
Git clone the repo to your local machine, and ensure you have python3 and the pygame module installed. The requirements.txt will install pygame if you don't already have it.

You can install this by running the below command.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can check this was installed by running.

`python3 -m pygame`

Once done, create the virtual env for Python and activate it.

`python3 -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

From here, you can now start playing! Just run the next command to start.

`python3 main.py`

# Controls
